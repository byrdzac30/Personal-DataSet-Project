# Personal-DataSet-Project

I was lucky enough to see the Warriors go to five straight NBA Finals and win three of them. 
For my personal dataset project I decided to pull statistics on Stephen Curry from October 29, 2009 to October 29, 2018, along with other statistics from Curry's teammates during the same years. These statistics will be used to show his impact for the Golden State Warriors during their championship runs. 


To start off, I pulled the raw data from all games Stephen Curry played in from 2009-2018. 
I was surprised to see that when Curry was in the game for 30-40 minutes the score between GSW and the opponent was relatively close.
Statistically, Curry has kept the games extremely close in his career but he dealt ankle issues in the early years of his career and did not truly break out as a player until the 2012-2013 season.
His most noteable game of that season was a big one. Curry scored 54 points on 11-13 shooting from the 3-point line.
