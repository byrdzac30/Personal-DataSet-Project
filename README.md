# Personal-DataSet-Project
In the sense of sports, most people are fans of their respected teams because of the area they live in or because their father, or older figure, was a fan of the team.
My dad grew up in Napa, California which means I have been a Warriors, 49ers, and Giants fan since I was born.
I was lucky enough to see the Warriors go to five straight NBA Finals and win three of them. 


For my personal dataset project I decided to pull statistics on Stephen Curry from October 29, 2009 to October 29, 2018.
These statistics will be used to show his impact in the NBA and for the Warriors during their championship runs.
