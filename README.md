# Personal-DataSet-Project
Introduction:

I was lucky enough to see the Warriors go to five straight NBA Finals and win three of them. For my personal dataset project I decided to pull statistics on Stephen Curry from October 29, 2009 to October 29, 2018, along with other statistics from Curry's teammates during the same years. These statistics will be used to show his impact for the Golden State Warriors during their championship runs. Shooting from beyond the 3-point line has been a staple of Curry's game. He has helped influence an entire generation of basketball players and has had a major impact on the shift to modern basketball we are now seeing in the NBA.

To start off, I pulled the raw data from all games Stephen Curry played in from 2009-2018, the figures above represent the amount of minutes Curry was in the game compared to the final score of the opponent and Golden State. I was surprised to see that when Curry was in the game for 30-40 minutes the score between GSW and the opponent was relatively close. Statistically, Curry has kept the games extremely close in his career but he dealt ankle issues in the early years of his career and did not truly break out as a player until the 2012-2013 season. His most noteable game of that season was a big one where Curry scored 54 points on 11-13 shooting from the 3-point line. I wanted to then take a look at the same data, but starting from the 2014 season.

If you'll notice from the figure above pulled from Game 5 of the 2015 NBA Finals, the team that shoots better from beyond ends up winning the game. Also, the team that shot more 3-pointers in the game lost every game except for one. In games 4 and 5, the Warriors dominated behind the 3-point line, shooting over 40% in both the matchups. It is not a coincidence, each year 3-pointers are becoming more important to the game and teams are adjusting their personnel to compete.
