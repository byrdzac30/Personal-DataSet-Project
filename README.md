# Personal-DataSet-Project
**Introduction**


The Golden State Warriors have been a dominate team in the NBA for the better part of the decade. They reached the NBA Finals five years in a row, from 2015 to 2019. For my personal dataset project I decided to pull statistics on Stephen Curry from October 29, 2009 to October 29, 2018, along with other statistics from Curry's teammates and opponents during the same years. These statistics will be used to show his impact for the Golden State Warriors during their championship runs. Shooting from beyond the 3-point line has been a staple of Curry's game, and has helped influence an entire generation of basketball players. The increased popularity in 3-point shooting has led to modernized play of basketball that we now see in the NBA. 





**Data From 2009-2018**

To start off, I pulled the raw data from all games Stephen Curry played in from 2009-2018, the figures above represent the amount of minutes Curry was in the game compared to the final score of the opponent and Golden State. I was surprised to see that when Curry was in the game for 30-40 minutes the score between GSW and the opponent was relatively close. Statistically, Curry has kept the games extremely close in his career but he dealt ankle issues in the early years of his career and did not truly break out as a player until the 2012-2013 season. His most noteable game of that season was a big one where Curry scored 54 points on 11-13 shooting from the 3-point line. From looking at the data, there seems to be a correlation between the Warriors scoring 115 points or more, and Curry playing about 28 minutes in the game. Even during the games Curry plays the full 48 minutes the scores seem to constistently be the same for both teams. To further examine I decided to narrow the data into only the 2014-2018 seasons.

Above I added figures focused on the 2014-2018 NBA seasons in which the Warriors reached the Finals. Surprisingly, even during the Warriors championship runs Curry was not impactful for the game being one-sided. This can be seen as a good and bad player statistic. On one hand, you know when Curry is playing 35 minutes the game will be close towards the end and can mold the gameplan accordingly. But, it can be strenuous on players to constistently have close games that will tire them out for future games on their schedule. Some things I did not factor in to my report that I wanted to are:

- During the final few minutes of games did Curry have any different impact than shown on the figures above.

- How Curry's nummbers change with certain teammates on the court with him, for example Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, etc.

- Curry's fourth quarter performances in the playoffs compared to the final quarter of regular season games.


**Conclusion**

Overall, I was a bit disappointed in the findings through my project since originally I expected Curry to have astounding number. As I mentioned above there were other player statistics I could have factored in to my report, as well as tons of other data that has been pulled and published by professional sports analysts.
